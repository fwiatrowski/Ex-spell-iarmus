#### Rules
Each person starts with 1000 HP points. They duel (cast spells) until one of them hits 0 HP points and loses. Obviously, as in the **real** magical world, the magiciansget tired, so they're losing some stamina points (initially 100) after casting each spell. The penalty for casting the spell which is not recognised is constant and equal to C. The stamina points rebuild with P points being received each second.

Spells:

*  ***Spell 1*** - 
* ***Spell 2*** - 
* ***Spell 3*** - 
* ...
