#### Rules
Each person starts with 100 HP. They duel (cast spells) until one of them hits 0 HP points and loses. Obviously, as in the **real** magical world, the magiciansget tired, so they're getting tired and lose some stamina points (initially 100) after spell. The stamina points are also lost after calling a spell badly (the penalty is 5 points). The stamina points rebuild with 1 point being rebuilt each second.

###### Spells:
 Spell name        |   Damage   |  Stamina  |  Level  |
:-----------------:|:----------:|:---------:|:-------:|
Praesent quis nulla|     5      |     3     |5        |
Duis rutrum justo  |    10      |     8     |4        |
Laoreet            |    15      |    13     |3        |
Tellus             |    20      |    18     |2        |
Ut eu              |    25      |    23     |1        |
Cras               |    40      |    38     |1        |

If your stamina does not allow you to cast the desired spell, you might queue your spells in the air so that when the stamina hits the needed level, the spell is automatically casted. Obviously, for some spells youi might need more experience, so they're unlocked only if you are at a given level. You get promoted to the next level if you cause a fixed number of damage.
